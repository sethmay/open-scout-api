# Changelog

One section per merge into `main`; newest first. Conventions: `skill://semver`.
Version anchors: this file only (no package manifests yet — add here when one appears).

- `PENDING` Import 469 camps from camp-finder into the camp dataset: classified by
  `camp_type` (361 resident / 68 day / 40 high-adventure) and `operator` (465 council +
  4 national HA bases — Philmont, Florida Sea Base, Northern Tier, Summit); Michigan
  Crossroads camps remapped to the kept council; demo councils excluded; description +
  sessions dropped (operational data stays at the council site). validate_data gains the
  camps dataset + council-ref + operator↔council coupling checks; build emits camp
  per-entity/index/current + a `CurrentCamp` published contract.

## 0.6.0 (minor) — 2026-07-21

- `919c1e8` Enrich the camp schema to handle every kind of scout camp: add `camp_type`
  (reservation / resident_camp / high_adventure_base / short_term_camp / day_camp /
  program_center / other), `operator` (council / national / other / unknown — represents
  national HA bases like Philmont with council=null), and a `parent` camp ref for
  reservation nesting; broaden `program_types` vocab. Example + negative fixture updated.

## 0.5.0 (minor) — 2026-07-21

- `36f4896` Seed 141 merit-badge requirement sets from OpenScouting/workbooks: full
  requirement tree (numbering, nesting, choose-N / option groups) + effective date +
  source links, with verbatim requirement text marked © Scouting America
  (`includes_official_text` + new `text_rights` field, excluded from the data license).
  validate_data + build extended (per-doc, index, current, badge join, `includes_official_text`
  ⇔ text invariant); NOTICE/README document the requirement-text rights boundary

## 0.4.0 (minor) — 2026-07-21

- `50b0844` Seed merit badge catalog: 142 badges (140 current, 17 Eagle-required incl.
  alternatives) from the OpenScouting/workbooks manifest + scouting.org; Citizenship in
  Society lifecycle (2021 → Eagle-required 2022 → discontinued 2026) and Computers→Digital
  Technology supersession as events; `url` added to merit-badge schema; build + validators
  + published `current` projection extended to the merit-badges dataset

## 0.3.1 (patch) — 2026-07-21

- `82c1ca5` Add README (repo is public): what it is, unofficial disclaimer, live `v1/` API
  endpoints + fetch examples, temporal data model, dataset status, local dev, contributing,
  CC BY-NC-SA/MIT licensing

## 0.3.0 (minor) — 2026-07-21

- `c8dab5d` Publish static API: `tools/build.py` compiles `data/` → `dist/` (path-versioned
  `v1/` — meta, per-dataset index + per-entity files with folded events, flat `current/`
  projections, schemas) with a published-projection schema + fail-fast contract check;
  `.github/workflows/pages.yml` gates (validators) and deploys to GitHub Pages on `main`

## 0.2.0 (minor) — 2026-07-21

- `8e7ec9b` Populate councils + territories: 235 council entities (229 assigned to
  the 14 Council Service Territories from official Scouting America maps, 6 defunct)
  + 20 territory entities (14 CSTs with 2021 NST→2024 CST history, 4 regions, 2 merged
  NSTs) + lifecycle events; CC BY-NC-SA data license; `tools/seed_councils_territories.py`
  generator and `tools/validate_data.py` gate (schema + referential + version windows)

## 0.1.0 (minor) — 2026-07-21

- `4a45757` Add project plan, dataset catalog (TODO.md), and v1 canonical schemas
  (common temporal core; council, territory, camp, merit-badge, requirement-set, events)
  with validated example instances and `tools/validate_examples.py`
